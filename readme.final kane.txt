add a bunch adds a lot of different numbers based off of what peramiters you give it 

index values tells you the index(s) of a number you give it 

sort list sorts mylist from smallest to largest after copying it

random search searches for an absolute random number and tells you the index

linear search goes through every number from index 0 to end and serches for a certain number

iteritive takes the whole sorted list and splits it in half and then asks if the number you are searching for is bigger or smaller than the mid point of the list and continues that action till the number you are searching for is midpoint

print lists gives you back your list with all the modifications youve done to the lists
